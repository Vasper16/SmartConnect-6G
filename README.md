# 🔗 SmartConnect 6G – Optimizing M2M Communication in Future IoT Networks

**SmartConnect 6G** is an AI-driven optimization framework that enhances the **Random Access (RA)** procedure in **LTE-Advanced (LTE-A)** networks using **Q-learning**, specifically designed for dense **Machine-to-Machine (M2M)** and **IoT** environments. The project addresses critical challenges in traditional RA such as high collision rates and access delays, paving the way for **ultra-reliable, low-latency communication** in emerging **6G networks**.

This system implements **adaptive preamble selection** using reinforcement learning, enabling IoT devices to learn from real-time network feedback and intelligently access channels. Extensive simulations in **MATLAB** validate the significant performance improvements of the proposed AI-optimized RA scheme over conventional LTE-A mechanisms.
